The site is now closed.

This site was built to
1. Scrape product details from Amazon from specific categories using an Amazon web scraper
2. Read mass amounts of reviews and perform sentiment analysis with AI
3. Generate SEO-optimized pages to provide customized 1:1 product comparisons between "all" products within a category
   ex. Monitors, Laptops, Phones, Cameras, etc
4. 1:1 product comparisons open up NxN level of article pages that can each be indexed on Google SEO. Each article is unique and significant (most of them do not exist on the internet yet, so it provides value). Google SEO algorithm appreciates this and does not flag our articles even if it is mass produced

To be honest, I ran out of money while running project and had to shut it down when it was at ~300visits per day with ~7000 pages. Cost for AI tokens and time it took to get return via small percentages on Amazon Affiliates was not enough to keep page up. Original plan was to get ~500,000 + pages in short amount of time to keep page self-sufficient financially.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
