The site is now closed.

This site was developed to:

1. Scrape Product Details: Extract product information from Amazon across specific categories using a custom-built Amazon web scraper.
Perform Sentiment Analysis: Process and analyze large volumes of product reviews with AI-driven sentiment analysis to derive meaningful insights.
2. Generate SEO-Optimized Pages: Create customized 1:1 product comparison pages for every product within a category (e.g., Monitors, Laptops, Phones, Cameras), optimized for search engine indexing.
3. Expand Content Reach: The 1:1 comparisons exponentially increased the number of unique article pages, enhancing SEO performance and ensuring each page provided valuable, unique content that was not widely available online. Google's SEO algorithm recognized the uniqueness and utility of these articles, which prevented them from being flagged as mass-produced content.

Unfortunately, the project faced financial challenges. Despite achieving around 300 daily visits and generating approximately 7,000 pages, the expenses for AI tokens and the time required to earn returns via Amazon Affiliates were unsustainable. The initial goal was to scale up to over 500,000 pages quickly to achieve financial self-sufficiency, but the costs ultimately led to the shutdown of the site.
